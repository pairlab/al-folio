#### Getting Involved

Thank you for your interest in our lab!  
We are accepting new students at all levels.
However, kindly *do not contact the PI directly* with regard to Graduate Admissions.  

Please see below and contact accordingly:

{% tabs hiring %}

{% tab hiring UG/MS %}

We recruit undergraduate and masters' students at all class levels, though a background in AI and machine learning, as well as excellent grades, are preferred.  
You must be **current (or admitted)** student at Georgia Tech and be enrolled during the time of your working in the lab.  
We typically interview new undergraduate researchers at the beginning of the term.  

Please [**complete this form**](https://forms.gle/BtFqLGV33kC5FXAu9) and send an [email](mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}).

{% endtab %}

{% tab hiring Graduate %}

If you are a **current (or admitted)** graduate (PhD or MS+PhD) student at Georgia Tech, then please send an [email](mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}) to discuss opportunities.   
If you are **not** a Georgia Tech student, kindly apply to either:

You may contact me **after** you have applied. I am unable to evaluate applications in email and cannot make admissions decisions.

In particular if you have a fellowship or would like to apply for one, we strongly recommend getting in touch.
